## Section Slides

I was a Section Leader for Code in Place 2023 and 2024, leading a weekly section of students over Zoom.  The course lasted 7 weeks and covered many topics in computer science and Python.  In the live sections, we went over new concepts and worked through hands-on exercises.

I created the slides in this repository for use in my weekly sections.
